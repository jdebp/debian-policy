  <section id="introduction">
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      This is a proposal to make <filename>debian/copyright</filename>
      machine-interpretable.  This file is one of the most important files in
      Debian packaging, yet there is currently no standard format defined for it
      and its contents vary tremendously across packages, making it difficult to
      automatically extract licensing information.
    </para>
    <para>
      Use of this specification is optional.
    </para>
    <para>
      Nothing in this proposal supersedes or modifies any of the
      requirements specified in Debian Policy regarding the appropriate detail
      or granularity to use when documenting copyright and license status in
      <filename>debian/copyright</filename>.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="rationale">
    <title>Rationale</title>
    <para>
      The diversity of free software licenses means that Debian needs to care
      not only about the freeness of a given work, but also its license's
      compatibility with the other parts of Debian it uses.
    </para>
    <para>
      The arrival of the GPL version 3, its incompatibility with version 2, and
      our inability to spot the software where the incompatibility might be
      problematic is one prominent occurrence of this limitation.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are earlier precedents, also. One is the GPL/OpenSSL
      incompatibility.  Apart from grepping
      <filename>debian/copyright</filename>, which is prone to numerous false
      positives (packaging under the GPL but software under another license) or
      negatives (GPL software but with an <quote>OpenSSL special
      exception</quote> dual licensing form), there is no reliable way to know
      which software in Debian might be problematic.
    </para>
    <para>
      And there is more to come.  There are issues with shipping GPLv2-only
      software with a CDDL operating system such as Nexenta. The GPL version 3
      solves this issue, but not all GPL software can switch to it and we have
      no way to know how much of Debian should be stripped from such a system.
    </para>
    <para>
      Even where licenses are DFSG-free and mutually compatible, users might want
      a way to avoid software with certain licenses, for example if they have a
      problem with the Affero GPL.
    </para>

  <section id="file-syntax">
    <title>File syntax</title>
    <para>
      The <filename>debian/copyright</filename> file must be
      machine-interpretable, yet human-readable, while communicating all
      mandated upstream information, copyright notices and licensing details.
    </para>
    <para>
      The syntax of the file is the same as for other Debian control files, as
      specified in the Debian Policy Manual.  See its <ulink
      url="http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields#s-controlsyntax">section
      5.1</ulink> for details. Extra fields can be added to any paragraph.  No
      prefixing is necessary or desired, but please avoid names similar to
      standard ones so that mistakes are easier to catch.  Future versions of
      the <filename>debian/copyright</filename> specification will attempt to
      avoid conflicting specifications for widely used extra fields.
    </para>
    <para>
      The file consists of two or more paragraphs.  At minimum, the file
      must include one <link linkend="header-paragraph">header
      paragraph</link> and one <link linkend="files-paragraph">Files
      paragraph</link>.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are four types of fields.  The definition for each field in this
      document indicates which type of value it takes.
    </para>

    <section id="single-line">
      <title>Single-line values</title>
      <para>
        A single-line value means that the whole value of a field must fit
        on a single line.  For example, the <varname>Format</varname> field
        has a single-line value specifying the version of the
        machine-readable format that is used.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="white-space-lists">
      <title>Whitespace-separated lists</title>
      <para>
        A whitespace-separated list means that the field value may be on one
        line or many, but values in the list are separated by one or more
        whitespace characters (including space, TAB, and newline).  For
        example, the <varname>Files</varname> field has a list of filename
        patterns.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="line-based-lists">
      <title>Line-based lists</title>
      <para>
        This means that the field has one value per line. For example,
        <varname>Upstream-Contact</varname> can list contact addresses, one per
        line.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="formatted-text">
      <title>Text formatted like package long descriptions</title>
      <para>
        Formatted text fields use the same rules as the long description in a
        package's <varname>Description</varname> field, possibly also using the
        first line  as a synopsis, like <varname>Description</varname> uses it
        for the short description. See Debian Policy's section 5.6.13, <ulink
        url="http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields#s-f-Description"><quote>Description</quote></ulink>,
        for details.  For example, <varname>Disclaimer</varname> has no special
        first line, whereas <varname>License</varname> does.
      </para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section id="paragraphs">
    <title>Paragraphs</title>
    <para>
      There are three kinds of paragraphs.  The first paragraph in the file
      is called the <link linkend="header-paragraph">header paragraph</link>.
      Every other paragraph is either a <link
      linkend="files-paragraph">Files paragraph</link> or a <link
      linkend="stand-alone-license-paragraph">stand-alone License

        can be used to summarise the contributions and redistribution terms
        for the whole package, for instance when a work combines a

        possible to use only <varname>License</varname> in the header

    </para>

    <section id="format-field">
      <title><varname>Format</varname></title>
      <para>
        Single-line: URI of the format specification, such as:

      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="upstream-name-field">
      <title><varname>Upstream-Name</varname></title>
      <para>
        Single-line: the name upstream uses for the software
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="upstream-contact-field">
      <title><varname>Upstream-Contact</varname></title>
      <para>
        Line-based list: the preferred address(es) to reach the upstream
        project.  May be free-form text, but by convention will usually be
        written as a list of RFC5322 addresses or URIs.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="source-field">
      <title><varname>Source</varname></title>
      <para>
        Formatted text, no synopsis: an explanation of where the upstream
        source came from.  Typically this would be a URL, but it might be a
        free-form explanation.  The Debian Policy section <ulink
        url="http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-docs#s-copyrightfile">12.5</ulink>
        requires this information unless there are no upstream sources,
        which is mainly the case for native Debian packages.  If the
        upstream source has been modified to remove non-free parts, that
        should be explained in this field.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="disclaimer-field">
      <title><varname>Disclaimer</varname></title>
      <para>
        Formatted text, no synopsis: this field can be used in the case of

      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="comment-field">
      <title><varname>Comment</varname></title>
      <para>
        Formatted text, no synopsis: this field can provide additional
        information.  For example, it might quote an e-mail from upstream
        justifying why the license is acceptable to the main archive, or an
        explanation of how this version of the package has been forked from
        a version known to be DFSG-free, even though the current upstream
        version is not.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="license-field">
      <title><varname>License</varname></title>
      <para>
        Formatted text, with synopsis.  In the header paragraph, this field
        gives the license information for the package as a whole, which may
        be different or simplified from a combination of all the per-file
        license information.  In a Files paragraph, this field gives the
        licensing terms for the files listed in the <varname>Files</varname>
        field for this paragraph.  In a stand-alone License paragraph, it
        gives the licensing terms for those paragraphs which reference it.
      </para>
      <para>
        First line: an abbreviated name for the license, or expression
        giving alternatives (see <link linkend="license-short-name">Short
        names</link> section for a list of standard abbreviations).  If
        there are licenses present in the package without a standard short
        name, an arbitrary short name may be assigned for these licenses. 
        These arbitrary names are only guaranteed to be unique within a
        single copyright file.
      </para>
      <para>
        If there are no remaining lines, then all of the short names
        or short names followed by license exceptions making up the
        first line must be described in <link
        linkend="stand-alone-license-paragraph">stand-alone License
        paragraphs</link>.  Otherwise, this field should either
        include the full text of the license(s) or include a pointer to the
        license file under <filename>/usr/share/common-licenses</filename>. 
        This field should include all text needed in order to fulfill both
        Debian Policy's requirement for including a copy of the software's
        distribution license (<ulink
        url="http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-docs#s-copyrightfile">12.5</ulink>),
        and any license requirements to include warranty disclaimers or
        other notices with the binary package.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="copyright-field">
      <title><varname>Copyright</varname></title>
      <para>
        Formatted text, no synopsis: one or more free-form copyright
        statement(s).  Any formatting is permitted; see the examples below
        for some ideas for how to structure the field to make it easier to
        read.  In the header paragraph, this field gives the copyright
        information for the package as a whole, which may be different or
        simplified from a combination of all the per-file copyright
        information.  In the Files paragraphs, it gives the copyright
        information that applies to the files matched by the
        <varname>Files</varname> pattern.  If a work has no copyright holder
        (i.e., it is in the public domain), that information should be
        recorded here.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <varname>Copyright</varname> field collects all relevant
        copyright notices for the files of this paragraph.  Not all
        copyright notices may apply to every individual file, and years of
        publication for one copyright holder may be gathered together.  For
        example, if file A has:
<programlisting>Copyright 2008 John Smith
Copyright 2009 Angela Watts</programlisting>
        and file B has:
<programlisting>Copyright 2010 Angela Watts</programlisting>
        then the <varname>Copyright</varname> field for a paragraph covering both
        file A and file B only needs to contain:
<programlisting>Copyright 2008 John Smith
Copyright 2009, 2010 Angela Watts</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
        The <varname>Copyright</varname> field may contain the original
        copyright statement copied exactly (including the word
        <quote>Copyright</quote>), or it can shorten the text, as long as it
        does not sacrifice information.  Examples in this specification use
        both forms.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="files-field">
      <title><varname>Files</varname></title>
      <para>
        Whitespace-separated list: list of patterns indicating files covered
        by the license and copyright specified in this paragraph.
      </para>
      <para>
        Filename patterns in the <varname>Files</varname> field are

      <para>
        Much of the value of a machine-parseable copyright file lies in being
        able to correlate the licenses of multiple pieces of software.  To that
        end, this spec defines standard short names for a number of commonly
        used licenses, which can be used in the first line of a
        <varname>License</varname> field.
      </para>
      <para>
        These short names have the specified meanings across all uses of this
        file format, and <emphasis>must not</emphasis> be used to refer to any
        other licenses.  Parsers may thus rely on these short names referring to
        the same licenses wherever they occur, without needing to parse or
        compare the full license text.
      </para>
      <para>
        From time to time, licenses may be added to or removed from the list of
        standard short names.  Such changes in the list of short names will
        always be accompanied by changes to the recommended
        <varname>Format</varname> value. Implementers who are parsing copyright
        files should take care not to assume anything about the meaning of
        license short names for unknown <varname>Format</varname> versions.
      </para>
      <para>
        Use of a standard short name does not override the Debian Policy
        requirement to include the full license text in
        <filename>debian/copyright</filename>, nor any requirements in the
        license of the work regarding reproduction of legal notices.  This
        information must still be included in the <varname>License</varname>
        field, either in a stand-alone License paragraph or in the relevant
        files paragraph.
      </para>
      <para>
        For licenses which have multiple versions in use, the version number is
        added, using a dash as a separator. If omitted, the lowest version
        number is implied. When the license grant permits using the terms of any
        later version of that license, the short name is finished with a plus
        sign. For <link linkend="spdx">SPDX</link> compatibility, versions with trailing
        <emphasis>dot-zeroes</emphasis> are considered to be equivalent to
        versions without (e.g., <quote>2.0.0</quote> is considered equal to
        <quote>2.0</quote> and <quote>2</quote>).
      </para>
      <para>
        Currently, the full text of the licenses is only available in the <ulink

        An exception or clarification to a license is signaled in plain text, by appending
        <literal>with <varname><replaceable>keywords</replaceable></varname>
        exception</literal> to the short name.  This document provides a list of
        keywords that must be used when referring to the most frequent
        exceptions.  When exceptions other than these are in effect that modify
        a common license by granting additional permissions, you may use an
        arbitrary keyword not taken from the below list of keywords.  When a
        license differs from a common license because of added restrictions
        rather than because of added permissions, a distinct short name should
        be used instead of <literal>with
        <varname><replaceable>keywords</replaceable></varname>
        exception</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Only one exception may be specified for each license within a given

            The <varname>License</varname> short name
            <literal>public-domain</literal> does not refer to a set of license
            terms. There are some works which are not subject to copyright in
            any jurisdiction and therefore no license is required for any
            purpose covered by copyright law. This short name is an explicit
            declaration that the associated files are <quote>in the public
            domain</quote>.
          </para>
          <para>
            Widespread misunderstanding about copyright in general, and the
            public domain in particular, results in the common assertion that a
            work is in the public domain when this is partly or wholly untrue
            for that work. The <ulink
            url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">Wikipedia article
            on public domain</ulink> is a useful reference for this subject.

            the corresponding files for that paragraph have from default
            copyright restrictions.

        License names are case-insensitive, and may not contain spaces.

      <para>
        In case of multi-licensing, the license short names are separated by
        <literal>or</literal> when the user can chose between different licenses,
        and by <literal>and</literal> when use of the work must simultaneously
        comply with the terms of multiple licenses.

        For instance, this is a simple, <quote>GPL version 2 or later</quote>
        field:
<programlisting>License: GPL-2+</programlisting>
        This is a dual-licensed GPL/Artistic work such as Perl:
<programlisting>License: GPL-1+ or Artistic</programlisting>
        This is for a file that has both GPL and classic BSD code in it:
<programlisting>License: GPL-2+ and BSD-3-clause</programlisting>
        For the most complex cases, a comma is used to disambiguate the
        priority of <literal>or</literal>s and <literal>and</literal>s.
        The conjunction <quote><literal>and</literal></quote> has priority over
        <quote><literal>or</literal></quote> unless preceded by a comma. For
        instance:
      </para>
      <simpara>
        <literal>A or B and C</literal> means <literal>A or (B and C)</literal>.
      </simpara>
      <simpara>
        <literal>A or B, and C</literal> means <literal>(A or B) and
        C</literal>.
      </simpara>
      <para>
        This is for a file that has Perl code and classic BSD code in it:
<programlisting>License: GPL-2+ or Artistic-2.0, and BSD-3-clause</programlisting>
        A <literal>GPL-2+</literal> work with the <literal>OpenSSL</literal>

        either under the <literal>GPL-2+</literal>, or under the
        <literal>GPL-2+</literal> with the <literal>OpenSSL</literal> exception.
        It is thus expressed as <literal>GPL-2+ with OpenSSL
